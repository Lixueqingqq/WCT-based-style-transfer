# WCT-based-style-transfer
This is a  tensorflow implementation of WCT based style transfer

WCT based style transfer was proposed by [Universal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms.](http://xueshu.baidu.com/s?wd=paperuri%3A%28af912f3490e8e1a6c23a027c8aa87cd8%29&filter=sc_long_sign&tn=SE_xueshusource_2kduw22v&sc_vurl=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1705.08086&ie=utf-8&sc_us=12956352176356800874)
It's core idea is to train a decoder to reconstruct general image from features which are generated by a pretrained VGG19.
When testing, we use a WCT layer to blend the features of content and style image. Then the trained decoder decodes the blended features to generate stylized image.
In the original paper, they trained 5 decoders for layer reluX(x=1,2,3,4,5) separately, and use them all to carry out multi-level stylization.

In this repository, we only trained 4 decoders for layer relu1-4.
